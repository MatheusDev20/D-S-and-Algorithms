  - O(1) Constant time, it does not matter the size of the input, the running time does not change.
  - O(Log N) - Double the input, does not double the running time, Binary search for example
  - O (N LOG N) - Sorting and Dividing and Conquer Algorithms
  - O (N^2) Loop inside another Loop, for each item in a array it checks every other item
